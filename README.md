# Common Data Structures and Utilities for Working in Idris.

This package is a dump of common data structures and utilities that I use for research, and are not defined elsewhere.

They are built:

> primarily with existence in mind rather than a dependently typed construction. The latter *may* will come later.

If you would like to contribute please see CONTRIBUTING.md that offers some guidance.

**Please note**, the code here is being used in **active** research, as such I might not accept changes due to the impact on my code.

## Testing and Build Quality

The code offered here are *rough and ready*. They may fail; they may not work as intended. There will be code duplication, there may not be documentation.

If there is something missing, that you would like to see please contribute. I welcome reasonable PR and changes to design.

Also please read the CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines, for everyone's sanity.
